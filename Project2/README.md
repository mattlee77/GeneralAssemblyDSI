### Overview

This week we learned how to craft appropriate problem statements, work with pivot tables, and started learning about Pandas. Additionally, we learned how to clean data and use dummy variables. Now, we're going to apply some of these newly acquired skills in our second project. Given a dirty dataset, you will do some exploratory data analysis. We'll be using actual data from the State of Iowa on liquor sales to generate some useful information. 

While data cleaning (affectionately known as data munging) can be a chore sometimes, it's critical to creating a good model for two reasons: 1) if you don't know your data well before you begin modeling on it, your assumptions will likely turn out to be quite wrong, and 2) if your data is messy or incomplete, your model's quality will suffer. Unsurprisingly, data science is very much a GIGO (garbage in, garbage out) process.

#### Project Summary

This week, we are providing a subset of data from the State of Iowa on liquor sales. The State of Iowa requires that entities licensed to sell liquor report their purchases to the State. This means that every time a store buys new liquor to sell to customers, it reports on that purchase (not individual purchases by customers!) to the state. The State of Iowa then provides this information free of charge to the public. You're asked to answer some fairly in-depth questions about trends in liquor sale purchases in Iowa and then to provide your own unique viewpoint on the data.

### Requirements

Requirements can be found in [requirements.md](./requirements.md) -- like last week, you will be generating a Python script that reads in the data and prints to screen information on data. Additionally, you'll be providing some of your own commentary and information within a markdown file.
