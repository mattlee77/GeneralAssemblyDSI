### Overview

For this project, we'll continue practicing functions and dive a little bit into some data analysis (finally!) It can be a little frustrating and uninteresting to practice functions and loops and all that straight out, but 1) it's incredibly useful to set you up for future success and 2) it can be really fun trying to problem solve and debug your creations!

### Requirements

You'll be creating a script to answer a number of programming riddles and some basic analysis. The information on what is expected can be found in [requirements.md](requirements.md). Information on submission is also found there.

### Due Date

This project is due on February 21st. You'll have time to approach the project on some afternoons and on Friday. We'll dedicate some time on Monday morning (via Slack, due to campus being closed for President's Day) to any outstanding questions. However, it is _strongly_ recommended that you take a look at the requirements before the weekend so you can hit the ground running for the bulk of the work over the weekend.

Happy coding!
